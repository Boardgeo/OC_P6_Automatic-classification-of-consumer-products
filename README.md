# OC_P6_Automatic-classification-of-consumer-products

## Context

Marketplace is a company that wants to launch an e-commerce platform where sellers offer items to buyers by posting a photo and a description. At present, customers manually post their items under the different catergories, making it an unreliable process. Considering an increase in the buyers and sellers patronages, the company wants to make the platform user friendly by automating the process of uploading of items by the sellers and search for products by the buyers.

## Goal:
 - Study the feasibility of an engine to classify items into different categories with a sufficient level of accuracy.

## Objectives:
My mission is to: 
- carry out a feasibility study of an article classification engine, based on an image and a description, for the automation of the attribution of the article category.
- to analyze the dataset by performing a preprocessing of the product descriptions and images, a dimension reduction and then a clustering using deep learning, unsupervised machine learning, and computer vision models.
- produce two-dimensional graphs, and confirmed by a similarity calculation between the real categories and the clusters, illustrating the fact that the extracted features allow clustering of products of the same category.
